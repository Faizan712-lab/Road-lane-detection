Model Training Suggestion:
If you want to train your DRL model, you can use Deep Q-Learning or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO):

Dataset: Use lane marking datasets like TuSimple or CULane.
Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with reinforcement learning.
Reward Function: Design rewards for correctly identifying lanes and penalties for wrongÂ predictions.
